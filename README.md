## Forecasting-MLB-Stats-Machine-Learning-PySpark-implementation
This is a collaborative implementation of the MLB-Season-Ending-Statistics-Predictors project using PySpark and the inclusion of a conference-style paper. 
The game of baseball is heavily driven by statistics, and with the advent of technology, teams are using analytics to make decisions regarding players 
and game strategies. 

### Process
The prediction process involves predicting the season ending statistics of HR, OBP, and RBI per player in 2021 season, using player data from the 2016-2020 seasons.

### Modeling
This project aims to predict a player's final season-ending statistics for certain categories using Linear Regression and XGBoost 
prediction models.

### How to use
To use this project, clone the repository and run the Jupyter notebook containing the code. Note that PySpark will need to be installed beforehand.
The notebook contains step-by-step instructions for pre-processing the data and making predictions using the two models. The conference-style paper 
provides an in-depth analysis of the project's process, methodology, and results.
